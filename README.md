# ai531-mnk
m,n,k game with MCTS

MCTS search to terminal nodes

Notes 5/18/22
TODO
-minimax/alpha beta: Wadood 
-mcts: Matthew & Joe
--mcts policy: Matthew & Joe
-data collection: Matthew
-two agents or 1 vs. human?
-mcts vs mcts, human vs. minimax, human vs mcts, mcts vs mini, mini vs mcts
-bound search by some criteria: time or nodes? 
-implement mcts and minimax, then play against human: state who goes first [we can count number of seconds each algo takes to pick a move] (record cumulative time of each bot over each game)

DONE?
-board

clarify: what bounds are we setting
  k <= m || k <= n
  max of m & n = 10, k=5?
  change all
  
  5,5,5
  6,6,5
  7,7,5
  8,8,5
  9,9,5
  10,10,5
